function problem = build_problem(n, N, M, I, J, H, kappa)
% Returns a problem structure containing all information pertaining to a
% rotation synchronization problem.
%
% INPUTS:
%
%  n = 2, 3 or 4: work with rotations in SO(n), i.e., n-by-n orthog. matrices
%  N : number of rotations to synchronize
%  M : number of measurements of rotation ratios
%  I, J : length-M vectors of indices between 1 and N
%  H : n-by-n-by-M matrix; Each matrix H(:, :, k) in SO(n) is a measurement
%      of the ratio Ra*Rb', where Ra is the I(k)'s rotation matrix to
%      synchronize and Rb is the J(k)'s rotation matrix to synchronize
%  kappa1,2 : length-M vectors of confidences in the M measurements
%  p : probability that a measurement is not an outlier
%  A : (optional) vector of indices of the anchors of the problem, i.e.,
%      indices of the known rotation matrices; if omitted, replaced by [1].
%  Ra : (optional) nxnx|A| matrix with anchored rotations; if omitted,
%       replaced by the identity matrix eye(n).
% 
% OUTPUTS:
%
%  problem : a structure containing all the given information plus some
%            precomputed data.
